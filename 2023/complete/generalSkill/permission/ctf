picoCTF{uS1ng_v1m_3dit0r_1cee9dcb}


Explanation:
	we move toward root directory
	cd ~
	we than run sudo commands and we see that sudo is not allowed for picoplayer
	we get a hint that if we run commands in vim they works like a sudo 
	so we open vim
	press esc and ! and then give space 
	and run command to see files present in root
	ls -a /root
	for getting a nicer output we run command like
	ls -al /root
	nice we get that a flag.txt file is hidden in root directory
	now we just need to print it to see a flag
	cat -al /root/.flag.txt
