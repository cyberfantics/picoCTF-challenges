in this chellange we have total money of 1100. and we need to buy a flag with money more than 10000

after seeing c program we get idea that total cost is decrement after purchasing someting 

but there is no way to increment it

we know that in 2's complement when we cross a certain limit the value goes toward negative

900 - 199
900 - - 199


in this way if we move value towards negative we can increase our balance


we know the concept of overflow so we increase our money by just overflowing integer value

let's start
