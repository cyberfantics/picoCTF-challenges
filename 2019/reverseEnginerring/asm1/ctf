0x6e8

Let's analyze the assembly code for `asm1`:

1. It compares the value at `[ebp+0x8]` with three different constants (`0x3a2`, `0x358`, and `0x6fa`).
2. Depending on the comparison results, it either adds or subtracts `0x12` from the value at `[ebp+0x8]`.
3. The final result is stored in the `eax` register.

Now, let's evaluate `asm1(0x6fa)`:

1. Compare `0x6fa` with `0x3a2`. Since `0x6fa` is greater, jump to `<+10>`.
2. Compare `0x6fa` with `0x358`. Since they are not equal, jump to `<+29>`.
3. Compare `0x6fa` with `0x6fa`. Since they are equal, jump to `<+46>`.
4. Subtract `0x12` from `0x6fa`.

Therefore, the final value in `eax` after executing `asm1(0x6fa)` is `0x6fa - 0x12`, which is `0x6e8`.

So, asm1(0x6fa) returns `0x6e8`. Please submit this value as a hexadecimal number, starting with '0x'.
